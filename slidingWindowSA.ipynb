It wasn't long before I had nothing left. Then, a severe famine struck, and I found myself penniless and hungry. Out of desperation, I found a job feeding pigs, but I was so hungry that I longed to eat the pig’s food. That’s when it hit me—my father's servants had more than enough to eat, yet here I was starving. I decided to go back to my father, prepared to beg him to take me in, not as his son, but as a servant. I rehearsed my apology the entire way. But as I approached, I saw my father running towards me. Before I could even finish my confession, he embraced me and kissed me. I was overwhelmed when he called for a celebration, dressing me in fine clothes and preparing a feast.

Then one day, while I was looking out toward the horizon, I saw him coming home. My heart leapt with compassion. I ran to him without hesitation. He began to apologize, but I didn't care about his past mistakes. I was just overjoyed to have him back. I told my servants to prepare a feast, clothe him in the best robe, and put a ring on his finger. My son, who I thought was lost forever, had returned. He was dead to the world, but now he was alive again. We had to celebrate. Yet, my other son felt hurt and angry.

Let’s have a feast and celebrate.  For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.\n",
    " “Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.  So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.  ‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’\n",
    " “The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.  But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’\n",
    " “‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. 32 But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”\n",
